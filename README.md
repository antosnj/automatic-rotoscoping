File 'automatic-rotoscoping.m' contains a program that takes an input video an applies automatic rotoscoping to it. Output is the processed .avi video (output video format can be changed if desired).

The provided .pdf file describes the methods and algorithm in detail.

I also provided a sample output of the algorithm (sample_output.gif).
