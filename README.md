# Automatic Rotoscoping

Automatic rotoscoping implementation using Matlab.

File 'automatic-rotoscoping.m' contains a program that takes an input video an applies automatic rotoscoping to it, and outputs the processed video (output_rotoscoped.avi), which is automatically located in the current working directory (output video format can be changed if desired).

PDF file report.pdf describes the methods and algorithm in detail.

I also provided a sample output of the algorithm (sample_output.gif).
